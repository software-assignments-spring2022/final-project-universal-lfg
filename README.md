# Universal LFG
Today's most popular video games are those that feature highly competitive multiplayer game modes. Whether it be Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Destiny, Valorant — or any other game — having a team you can communicate with can mean the difference between winning and losing. 
Universal LFG (Looking for Group) is a platform that aims to connect players to their new teammates.

### Who is Universal LFG For?
The end users of Universal LFG would be gamers who are interested in connecting with others to play their favorite games together. 

### Universal LFG - Breakdown
Typical user experience will be as follows:
* Registration/Login
    * Registration: User creates and populates their profile (username, age, etc.). User can indicate what platforms they are active on, as well as their usernames for those platforms.  
    * Login: If user has an active account, they can log in. Logged in users are redirected to the **homepage**
* Homepage 
    * Users can add games to their homepage. When this is done, clickable icons for each games are rendered on the page, giving users access to the **LFG boards/forum** for those games. 
* Create and browse LFG posts
    * Create Post:  User specifies the activity they would like to play (example: ranked or public matches) as well as other join criteria they may have (level, rank, etc.). User also specifies how many people they need for that activity. That post is then published to the public board. It would be cool to see a real-time visualization of empty player slots being filled. Once all slots are filled, the post is locked. 
    * Browse: User can browse through posts. If they see there is a group that planning on doing an activity that interests them, they can select that post and click on an empty slot to join.

### Scope
At its core, Universal LFG would be a collection of forum-type pages. Ideally, "Universal" would imply the ability to access LFG boards for all relevant games, but for the sake of being able to finish the project in a semester, the group should decide on a limited number of games to set up boards for. Additionally, the boards should be of high quality, with selection options specific to each game. Although it is challenging to determine the difficulty of the project, I believe it should be engaging enough for a group of 4-6. 

### Version Control

In order to run the app on your personal device, please ensure that the code repository is updated in your local computer. In the terminal, navigate to the front-end directory by running 'cd front-end' from the final-project-universal-lfg folder in your directory.

To ensure that Expo is running properly, attempt to run the command 'expo start'.

If there are issues, you may try to install the newest version of Expo by running the following:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Users with iPhone devices:
1. Install the Expo app on your iPhone device.
2. Running 'expo start' in the front-end folder results in the console displaying a QR code. Scan this QR code with your iPhone's camera.
3. The QR code should take you to the Expo app, where the project will compile and run. 
4. You should now be able to see and interact with the app.

Users without iPhone devices:
1. Install and download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) on your laptop.
2. Start Expo by typing the 'expo start' command in terminal.
3. Open Android Studio.
4. Open the project in Android Studio.
5. Open the 'AVD manager' from the Android Studio toolbar.
6. Run an Android emulator.
7. Click 'run on Android device/emulator' in the Expo client (displayed on console after running 'expo start').
8. You should now be able to see and interact with the app.
