# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms

* The team will communicate with each other primarily through a private Discord server. A separate private Discord channel with stakeholders should be used to communicate updates or progress made on group or individual contributions.
* Team members should aim to respond to messages in the Discord server on a timely basis, no longer than the time between each standup meeting.
* Any disagreements in direction or conflicts should be brought up promptly by involved parties and resolved in a meeting, or privately through Discord if applicable.
* Each sprint for this team will take 2 weeks.
* Standup meetings will occur at least once weekly on a time agreed upon by team members. Team members are expected to show up on time to present.
* If a team member should make no progress on assigned tasks for two standups or more in a row, the matter will be brought up to management.
* Always push working code with descriptive commit messages.
* Write self-documenting code with descriptive variable and function names.
* Delete any dead/commented code.
* Don't over-engineer! Prioritize writing minimum code to get things working end-to-end.

## Git Workflow

* The team will primarily follow a Centralized Workflow. All team members will clone the repository on their personal devices and push/pull to the main branch as necessary.

## Contributing

* When making contributions, keep in mind considerations surrounding the purpose of the project and the goal of the product. View the UX-DESIGN files in the repository to get a better idea of what the product is looking for.
* A pull request should be submitted with any contributions that were not previously discussed with the team.

## Local Development Environment

* The local development environment should allow team members to comfortably view documents in the repository and contribute in any relevant programming languages. Visual Studio Code is a good option.
